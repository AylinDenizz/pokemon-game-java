# Pokemon-Game-Java

Pokemon-Game-Java is a fun and interactive text-based Pokemon game realized in Java. This project aims for players to relive the excitement of catching, training and fighting Pokemon in a command line environment.

## Features

###Game Mechanics
At the start, players need to press any key to begin the game.
Players then choose their characters from a list of available characters (e.g., Ash or Brock) for player 1 and player 2.
Next, each player selects a Pokemon for their character from a list of available Pokemon (e.g., Pikachu, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, or Charmander).
The battle begins with a random weather condition that affects the power of Pokemon moves.
During each round, players choose an attack move for their Pokemon. They can perform a regular attack, a PokeSpecialAttack, a CharSpecialAttack, or both.
The game calculates the damage dealt to the opponent's Pokemon based on the chosen moves and their effectiveness against the opponent's Pokemon type.
The battle continues in rounds until one of the player's Pokemon runs out of health points (HP).
The game then declares the winner based on which player's Pokemon has more remaining HP.
###Weather Conditions
The game features various weather conditions (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Foggy) that impact the power of Pokemon moves during battles.
The current weather condition is randomly chosen at the start of each round.
Different Pokemon types may receive a boost or penalty in their move power based on the weather condition.
